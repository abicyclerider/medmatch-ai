# MedMatch AI - Project Context

## What We're Building
An AI-powered medical entity resolution system that prevents wrong-patient errors in healthcare by using Google's MedGemma 1.5 to understand full medical context - not just demographics, but medical histories, imaging patterns, and treatment timelines.

## The Competition
- **Goal:** Build innovative healthcare applications using MedGemma's multimodal medical AI capabilities

## The Problem We're Solving
Wrong-patient medical errors (operating on the wrong John Smith) are "never events" that cause deaths. Current systems use basic name matching. Our solution uses deep medical understanding to create "medical fingerprints" that ensure accurate patient matching at critical decision points.

## Technical Foundation Needed
A Python AI/ML development environment for:
- Working with Google's MedGemma 1.5 (4B parameter medical LLM)
- Processing medical records, lab reports, imaging data
- Building matching algorithms with explainable AI
- Creating a user interface for clinical workflows
- Rapid prototyping and iteration

## Platform
MacBook Pro (use MPS/Metal acceleration for PyTorch)

**Bottom line:** Set me up with everything needed to build a production-quality medical AI application using MedGemma, ready to start development immediately.
